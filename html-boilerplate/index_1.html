       <h1>BLOGPOST#1: LISTS, lists, and lots and lots of lists</h1>
       <h2>The Assignment (A list)</h2>
       <p>
           For my assignment, I need to practice making lists. Below are the lists that I have to
           make. For the record, there is no one checking these assignments and most of these
           are intended to make me improve.
       </p>
       <ol>
            <li>An ordered list of todo's you need to get done today</li>   
            <li>An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods</li>
            <li>An unordered list of places you'd like to visit someday</li>
            <li>An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies</li>
       </ol>
       
       <h2>List <span>numero uno </span>(To-do's today)</h2>
       <p>
           For the first list (<em>actually</em> my second one since The Assignment is also a list)
           A list of my to-do's today, and since it's 15:31 as I write this, there really shouldn't be much here.
       </p>
       <ol>
           <li>Finish this assignment</li>
           <li>Do my mobile game dailies (missions and quests)</li>
           <li>Apply for jobs</li>
           <li>Play some DQ XI (I play way too much games)</li>
           <li>Try to sleep early</li>
       </ol>

       <h2><span>Pangalawang</span> list! (Shopping list)</h2>
       <p>
           Well I don't really shop for food since I live with my parents, so I'd just list my favorite dishes.
           This list is unordered, so the dishes below aren't really ranked (don't judge me please).
       </p>
       <ul>
           <li>Pasta carbonara</li>
           <li>Sisig liempo</li>
           <li>Pastries, desserts, chocolate (Very general yes I know, I like sweets and I can't name them all)</li>
           <li>Tuna sandwiches (Simple and also it really sustained me in college)</li>    
       </ul>

       <h2>List <span lang="fr">troisi√®me</span> (List of places I'd like to travel)</h2>
       <p>
           I'm runnning out of things to say honestly. Travelling places is a bit beyond me right now as I'm currently a <strong><em>NEET</em></strong>.
           I really know nothing about travelling at all. Anyways here's the list.
            <ul>
                <li>Canada maybe?</li>
                <li>Somewhere in Europe</li>
                <li>Japan or Korea?</li>
                <li>Australia, I guess</li>
            </ul>
            Whoop dee doo.
        </p>

        <h2>4th List(Video games or movies)</h2>
        <p>

            video games. I'll pick the games that I played in my childhood so don't complain if your favorite's
